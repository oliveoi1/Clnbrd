# ✅ Build Number System - Setup Complete!

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Current Version**: 1.3 (Build 4)

---

## 🎉 What's New

Your Clnbrd project now has **automatic build number incrementing**!

Every time you build for distribution, the build number will automatically increment, making it easy to track which version you're testing.

---

## 📝 Files Created

1. **`Scripts/Build/increment_build_number.sh`**
   - Increments build number
   - Updates Info.plist and VersionManager.swift
   - Records entry in build history

2. **`Scripts/Build/view_build_history.sh`**
   - Shows all builds with timestamps and notes
   - Displays recent builds in color-coded format

3. **`.build_history.txt`**
   - Stores all build records (automatically created)
   - Added to .gitignore (local tracking only)

4. **`BUILD_NUMBER_GUIDE.md`**
   - Complete guide on using the build number system
   - Examples and troubleshooting

## 🚀 How to Use

### Build for Distribution (Auto-Increment)
```bash
./build_distribution.sh
```
This will:
1. Increment build number (e.g., 4 → 5)
2. Build the app
3. Create DMG
4. Record in history

### Manual Increment with Note
```bash
./Scripts/Build/increment_build_number.sh "Fixed hotkey bug"
```

### View Build History
```bash
./Scripts/Build/view_build_history.sh
```

### Check Current Version
```bash
plutil -p Clnbrd/Info.plist | grep -E "(Version|Build)"
```

## 📊 Current Status

**Version**: 1.3  
**Build**: 4  
**Last Build**: 2025-10-04 09:46:04  
**Note**: Testing automatic build number system

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Restart your computer** (as planned)
2. **Grant permissions** (Accessibility + Input Monitoring)
3. **Test the app**
4. When you make changes and rebuild:
   ```bash
   ./build_distribution.sh
   ```
   The build number will automatically go from 4 → 5!

---

## 💡 Benefits

- ✅ **No more confusion** about which build you're testing
- ✅ **Easy to track** what changed between builds
- ✅ **Automatic** - no manual tracking needed
- ✅ **Build history** shows all your iterations
- ✅ **Professional** like real production apps

---

## 📖 Example Workflow

### Testing a Bug Fix
```bash
# Current: Version 1.3 (Build 4)

# You fix a bug, then build:
./build_distribution.sh
# → Version 1.3 (Build 5)

# Test it, find another issue, fix it:
./build_distribution.sh
# → Version 1.3 (Build 6)

# Check what you did:
./Scripts/Build/view_build_history.sh
```

Output:
```
2025-10-04 09:46:04 | Version 1.3 | Build 4
           └─ Testing automatic build number system
2025-10-04 10:15:00 | Version 1.3 | Build 5
           └─ Automated build via build_distribution.sh
2025-10-04 10:30:00 | Version 1.3 | Build 6
           └─ Automated build via build_distribution.sh
```

## 🔄 When to Change Version Number

**Keep version the same** (1.3) and auto-increment build:
- Bug fixes
- Testing
- Small tweaks

**Manually change version** (1.3 → 1.4):
- New features
- Major updates
- Public releases

Update version in:
1. `Info.plist` → `CFBundleShortVersionString`
2. `VersionManager.swift` → `version`

- **`BUILD_NUMBER_GUIDE.md`** - Full guide with examples
- **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`** - App status and troubleshooting
- **`.build_history.txt`** - All build records

## ✅ Verification

Run this to verify everything is working:
```bash
# Check current version
plutil -p Clnbrd/Info.plist | grep -E "(Version|Build)"

# View build history
./Scripts/Build/view_build_history.sh

# Test increment (this will increment to Build 5!)
./Scripts/Build/increment_build_number.sh "Testing verification"
```

---

**Your next build will be: Version 1.3 (Build 5)** 🎉

Happy building! 🚀
