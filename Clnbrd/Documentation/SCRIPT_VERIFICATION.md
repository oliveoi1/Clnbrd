# Build Scripts Verification

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**After:** Major project organization and cleanup  
**Status:** ✅ All scripts verified and working

## Scripts Verified

### 1. build_notarization_fixed.sh
**Purpose:** Main build script for creating notarized builds  
**Status:** ✅ Working correctly

**Dependencies Verified:**
- ✅ `Clnbrd/Info.plist` - Found and accessible
- ✅ `Clnbrd/Clnbrd.entitlements` - Found and accessible
- ✅ `Clnbrd.xcodeproj` - Found and accessible
- ✅ All paths use absolute references via `$PROJECT_DIR`

**Test Results:**
```
VERSION: 1.3
BUILD_NUMBER: 52
SCRIPT_DIR: /Users/allanalomes/Documents/AlsApp/Clnbrd/Clnbrd
PROJECT_DIR: /Users/allanalomes/Documents/AlsApp/Clnbrd/Clnbrd
Entitlements: Found
```

---

### 2. finalize_notarized_clean.sh
**Purpose:** Post-notarization stapling and DMG creation  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and working correctly

**Issue Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ Line 92 referenced undefined `$PROJECT_DIR` variable
- ✅ Fixed: Added `SCRIPT_DIR` variable and updated all paths

**Dependencies Verified:**
- ✅ `Distribution-Clean/` directory (created by build script)
- ✅ All paths now use `$SCRIPT_DIR` for reliability

**Test Results:**
```
SCRIPT_DIR: /Users/allanalomes/Documents/AlsApp/Clnbrd/Clnbrd
DISTRIBUTION_DIR: /Users/allanalomes/Documents/AlsApp/Clnbrd/Clnbrd/Distribution-Clean
```

## Files NOT Affected by Cleanup

The following critical files were **NOT moved** during organization:

### Source Code (Unchanged)
- `Clnbrd/` - All Swift source files
- `Clnbrd/Info.plist` - App configuration
- `Clnbrd/Clnbrd.entitlements` - Security settings
- `Clnbrd/Assets.xcassets/` - App assets
- `Clnbrd/PFMoveApplication.h/m` - LetsMove integration
- `Clnbrd/Clnbrd-Bridging-Header.h` - Objective-C bridge
- `Clnbrd.xcodeproj/` - Xcode project

### Active Scripts (Unchanged)
- `build_notarization_fixed.sh` - Main build
- `finalize_notarized_clean.sh` - Finalization (fixed)

### Configuration (Unchanged)
- `../appcast-v2.xml` - Sparkle update feed
- `../screenshots/` - App screenshots

---

## What Was Moved (Archived)

These files were moved but **are not used by active scripts:**

### Documentation (Archived)
- Old notarization guides → `Archive/Old_Documentation/`
- Build 50-51 summaries → `Archive/Build_History/`
- Old Documentation folder → `Archive/Old_Documentation/OldDocs/`

### Scripts (Archived)
- `build_distribution.sh` → `Archive/Old_Scripts/`
- `build_distribution_improved.sh` → `Archive/Old_Scripts/`
- `test_letsmove.sh` → `Archive/Old_Scripts/`
- `verify_letsmove_setup.sh` → `Archive/Old_Scripts/`

### Backups (Archived)
- All `appcast*.backup` files → `Archive/Backups/`
- `Info.plist.backup` → `Archive/Backups/`
- Old `appcast.xml` files → `Archive/Backups/`

---

## Current Documentation Structure

Active documentation has been organized in `Documentation/`:

```
Clnbrd/Documentation/
├── BUILD_LESSONS_LEARNED.md     # Build process guide (CURRENT)
├── BUILD_51_LETSMOVE_SETUP.md   # LetsMove integration guide
├── PROJECT_README.md             # Internal project docs
└── SCRIPT_VERIFICATION.md        # This file
```

---

## Safety Checks Performed

1. ✅ **Script Initialization Test** - Both scripts can set variables correctly
2. ✅ **File Access Test** - All required files are accessible
3. ✅ **Path Resolution Test** - All paths resolve to correct locations
4. ✅ **No Build Test** - Scripts verified without running full builds

---

## Future Build Workflow

The verified workflow for future builds:

### Build Process
```bash
cd /Users/allanalomes/Documents/AlsApp/Clnbrd/Clnbrd
./build_notarization_fixed.sh
```

**Inputs Required:**
- Source code in `Clnbrd/`
- `Info.plist` with version info
- `Clnbrd.entitlements` file
- Valid signing identity

**Outputs Created:**
- `Distribution-Clean/App/Clnbrd.app`
- `Distribution-Clean/Upload/*.zip`
- `Distribution-Clean/Logs/`

### Finalization Process
```bash
# After notarization succeeds:
./finalize_notarized_clean.sh
```

**Inputs Required:**
- `Distribution-Clean/App/Clnbrd.app` (from build script)
- Successful notarization (ticket available online)

**Outputs Created:**
- Stapled app in `Distribution-Clean/App/`
- `Distribution-Clean/Upload/*-stapled.zip` (for Sparkle)
- `Distribution-Clean/DMG/*.dmg` (for distribution)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All scripts are safe and functional after cleanup**  
✅ **No build dependencies were affected**  
✅ **One issue fixed in finalize_notarized_clean.sh**  
✅ **Ready for future builds**

## Verification Command

To re-verify scripts at any time:

```bash
cd /Users/allanalomes/Documents/AlsApp/Clnbrd/Clnbrd

# Quick verification
bash -c 'VERSION=$(plutil -extract CFBundleShortVersionString raw Clnbrd/Info.plist); BUILD_NUMBER=$(plutil -extract CFBundleVersion raw Clnbrd/Info.plist); echo "Version: $VERSION"; echo "Build: $BUILD_NUMBER"; echo "Entitlements: $([ -f Clnbrd/Clnbrd.entitlements ] && echo OK || echo MISSING)"; echo "Scripts: $(ls -1 *.sh | wc -l | xargs) found"'
```

Expected output:
```
Version: 1.3
Build: 52
Entitlements: OK
Scripts: 2 found
```
