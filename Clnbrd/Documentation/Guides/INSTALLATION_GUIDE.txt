CLNBRD INSTALLATION GUIDE
========================

Welcome to Clnbrd! This guide will help you install and set up the app properly.

IMPORTANT: macOS SECURITY WARNING
=================================

When you first try to open Clnbrd, macOS will show a security warning because the app is not signed by Apple. This is normal for apps distributed outside the App Store.

WHAT TO EXPECT:
- A dialog saying "Clnbrd.app cannot be opened because it is not from an identified developer"
- Or "Clnbrd.app was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"

HOW TO FIX THIS:
1. Go to System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS)
2. Click on "Privacy & Security"
3. Scroll down to find "Clnbrd.app was blocked"
4. Click "Open Anyway"
5. Click "Open" in the confirmation dialog
6. Clnbrd will now launch normally

ALTERNATIVE METHOD (if the above doesn't work):
1. Right-click on Clnbrd.app in Finder
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog
4. This bypasses the security warning

REQUIRED PERMISSIONS
===================

After Clnbrd launches, you'll need to grant TWO permissions:

1. ACCESSIBILITY PERMISSION (Required for paste simulation)
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   • Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
   • Find "Clnbrd" in the list
   • Toggle it ON
   
   QUICK SHORTCUT:
   Run this command in Terminal to open directly:
   open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Accessibility"

2. INPUT MONITORING PERMISSION (Required for hotkey detection)
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   • Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring
   • Find "Clnbrd" in the list
   • Toggle it ON
   
   QUICK SHORTCUT:
   Run this command in Terminal to open directly:
   open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ListenEvent"

3. RESTART CLNBRD
   After granting both permissions, quit and relaunch Clnbrd.

WHY THESE PERMISSIONS ARE NEEDED:
• Accessibility: Allows Clnbrd to simulate the paste (⌘V) action
• Input Monitoring: Allows Clnbrd to detect when you press ⌘⌥V

These are standard macOS security requirements for any app that
monitors keyboard shortcuts. Even Apple's own apps require these!

SETTINGS & ANALYTICS
===================

Clnbrd includes optional privacy-focused analytics to help improve the app:

WHAT'S TRACKED (when enabled):
• Number of cleaning operations
• Which cleaning methods are used most
• Error types and frequency
• App session count
• Update check success/failure

WHAT'S NOT TRACKED:
• Clipboard content
• Personal information
• File names or paths
• User identity

PRIVACY CONTROLS:
• Analytics enabled by default to help improve the app
• Can be disabled anytime in Settings
• All data stays local on your device
• No data is sent anywhere
• Automatic cleanup of old data (1 year)

TROUBLESHOOTING
==============

If the hotkey doesn't work:
1. Make sure Clnbrd has BOTH permissions:
   • Accessibility ✓
   • Input Monitoring ✓
2. Try restarting Clnbrd
3. Check that no other app is using the same hotkey

QUICK PERMISSION CHECK:
• Accessibility: open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Accessibility"
• Input Monitoring: open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ListenEvent"

If you get "Permission denied" errors:
1. Make sure Clnbrd is in your Applications folder
2. Try moving it there if it's elsewhere

If you need to reset settings:
1. Open Settings
2. Click "View Analytics" to see usage data
3. Click "Reset Analytics" to clear all data
