## üìà Why Archive?

These documents are archived because:

1. **Completed Tasks:** Some docs describe one-time setup/cleanup tasks that are now done
2. **Point-in-Time Snapshots:** Structure docs will become outdated as project evolves
3. **Historical Context:** Useful to understand decisions and evolution, but not current state
4. **Reduce Clutter:** Keep current docs clean and easy to find
