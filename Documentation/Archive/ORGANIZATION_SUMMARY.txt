Documentation/               # Repo-level docs (organized)
_Archive/                    # Old projects & builds (not in git)
PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md         # Complete structure guide
README.md                    # Repo README
appcast.xml                  # Auto-update feed
version.json                 # Version info
```
